# Ground Control Configuration Samples

This is a listing of configuration samples for the `controls` on a
typical configuration file.  


You can take inspiration from these based on the things you run on your Pi,
or perhaps more suitable for the distro you're using.


You're very welcome to add your own sample with pull requests so
others can take a look at your ideas.


### xbmc-transmission-general

A Pi running xbmc, transmission and some general controls.

Notes:

* `refresh_airplay` is useful for some versions of XBMC where AirPlay is
quirky (disappears or hangs on your Mac as an audio output).
